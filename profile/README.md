**This is the home of the AMR Rules project on GitHub.**

An overview of the concept, with example rules and code, is available in the [AMRrules](https://github.com/interpretAMR/AMRrules) repository.

We are partnering with [ESGEM, the ESCMID Study Group on Epidemiological Markers](https://www.escmid.org/esgem/), to form an ESGEM-AMR Working Group to curate organism-specific rule sets. Membership of the working group is open to anyone with relevant expertise, you do not have to be an ESGEM member. 

If you would like to get involved, please:

1. Consider [registering to attend](https://forms.gle/9cBP821bDmyyaVZe8) one of the intro sessions to find out if this is the group for you:
